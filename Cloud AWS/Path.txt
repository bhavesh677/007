Path:
- path is the complete location or name of where a computer, file, device, or web page is located.
- Path specifies a unique location in a file system.

Absolute Path:
- an Abolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch until the path to the desired dir/file is completed.
- eg. C:\Users\praz1\VITADBDA-03\Cloud AWS
- if you want to reuse the code use absolute path
- readability is high

Relative Path:
- Absolute path name starts with working (current) directory.
. --> working directory eg. cd . (working/current dir)
.. --> working directory's parent directory eg. cd .. (current directory's parent)
- it makes code dynamic 
- readabilty is lost

Whis one is best ?
- It depends on situation that which path method is suitable for that situation.
