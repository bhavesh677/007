# ***Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)***

- you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

- It gives any developer access to the highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure.

***Buckets:***
- To upload your data (photos, videos, documents etc.) to Amazon S3, you must first create an S3 bucket in one of the AWS Regions. You can then upload any number of objects to the bucket.
- Data is stored as objects within resources called “buckets”, and a single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size.
- An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by all AWS accounts. This means that after a bucket is created, the name of that bucket cannot be used by another AWS account in any AWS Region until the bucket is deleted. 
- If you don't specify a Region when you create a bucket, Amazon S3 creates the bucket in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. Therefore, if you need to create a bucket in a specific Region, you must specify the Region when you create the bucket.

***Hosting a static website on Amazon S3:***
- You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website.
